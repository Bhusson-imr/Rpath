Rpath
=====
This is the repository for Rpath - the R version of the Ecopath with Ecosim model

The initial files are the code sent by Kerim to Sean on March 31, 2014 (ecopath_sim_r_v0_04_toSean_31_03_14.zip)
Files have been renamed to drop the version number and take advantage of this VCS

Beta version notes:

v0.0.0.904 - Data.table package updated and created a few bugs that have been solved.

v0.0.0.903 - Fixed issue with consumption calculations due to the addition of
diet import in the diet matrix.

Did not keep good track of notes prior to version 0.0.0.9003 - My Bad
