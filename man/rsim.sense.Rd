\concept{Rpath functions

This function generates random parameters around a given rsim scenario
object.  

It has been tested to give the same results as Whitehouse and Aydin 
(Submitted) when supplied with a straight-from-ecopath rsim secnario.
and the same random seed - though some minor bug corrections have been
found in the previous version (previous version is rsim.sense.path)}
